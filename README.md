# X-PLAIN: A Rule-based, model agnostic, classifier explainability framework

![Python package](https://github.com/mrandri19/tirocinio/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

TODO: binder and read the docs link

$name is a rule-based, model-agnostic method that explains the prediction of any classifier on a specific instance by analyzing the joint effect of feature subsets on the classifier prediction. The relevant subsets are identified by learning a local rule-based model in the neighborhood of the prediction to explain.

## Installation
